      <h1>Gettysburg Address</h1>
      <p>
        Delivered at Gettysburg, PA by President Lincoln on November 19, 1863.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fourscore and seven years ago our fathers brought forth, on this
        continent, a new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedicated to the
        proposition that all men are created equal. Now we are engaged in a
        great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so
        conceived, and so dedicated, can long endure. We are met on a great
        battle-field of that war. We have come to dedicate a portion of that
        field, as a final resting-place for those who here gave their lives,
        that that nation might live.
      </p>
      <p>It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this.</p>
      <p>
        But, in a larger sense, we cannot dedicate, we cannot consecrate—we
        cannot hallow—this ground. The brave men, living and dead, who struggled
        here, have consecrated it far above our poor power to add or detract.
      </p>
      <p>
        The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it
        can never forget what they did here.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished
        work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced. It is
        rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before
        us—that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause
        for which they here gave the last full measure of devotion—that we here
        highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain—that this
        nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom, and that
        government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not
        perish from the earth.
